var instance
var heuristic_mode: int


## Class Constructor.
## Injecting the main instance to this object to ensure data liability.
## Heuristic mode goes from 0 to 2 and follow thoses specifications:
##	0: Plays the biggest card possible every turn to make the last players go as far as possible.
##	1: Plays the chances cases as much as possible to spare the maximum of high cards.
##	2: Combine both 0 and 1 heuristics to improve the chances for the team to go the fartest.
##		In this heuristic, the card chosen will take into account the maximum bid from the chances cases,
##		in our actual implementation it has 57% chances to be a positive outcome.
##		In a minmax situation, that means that we can take into account that positive outcome so that
##		we can play towards those cases by adding the maximum value to our case picking card.
##		i.e: deck = [2,3,5] ==> chance case at 3, so the maximum mouvement would be 3 + 3 and so 6.
##			So, the player plays the card "3" instead of "5" because it is the best chance to get a
##			"6" without using the said card (which in this case he doesn't have) and to save the "5"
##			which would be lower than "6". Doing so, we can have a positive outcome of our move at 57%
##			chance and thus saving our high card for later to go further into the game faster.
##	3: Same as the heuristic 2, but takes into account the possibility to block other players path
##		by looking at which cards they have and if it's possible to make them pass their turn with
##		one of our movements cards.
